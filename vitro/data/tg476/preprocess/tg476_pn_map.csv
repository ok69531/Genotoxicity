negative,negative
positive,positive
ambiguous,
not specified,
other: mutation frequency was elevated relative to controls in some dose groups for nickel carbonate,
other:  “no clear mutagenic response… although a dose-related increase in the absolute frequency of small mutant colonies was seen”,
other: negative for trifluorothymidine resistance with S9; inconclusive without S9,
not determined,
other: Not determined due to lack of cytotoxic response up to solubility limits of test substance,
other: equivocal to weakly mutagenic response,
"other: The test substance LCE 10030 exhibited significantly increased mutant frequencies at the higher test concentrations due to cytotoxic effects under the tested conditions, though no clastogenic effect was observed as an increase in small colonies.",
other: the increases in mutant frequency were small and only occurred at a dose that caused high toxicity. The result was judged to indicate  borderline activity,
other: inconclusive,
other: mutation frequency was elevated relative to controls in some dose groups for both black and green NiO,
other: experiment was repeated for clarification and found negative,negative
other: questionable (1st trial) & positive (2nd trial),
other: weak positive,positive
other: at 8000 µg/mL 22 mutants / 1.000.000 cells in the presence of S9-mix - considered to be a fortuitous finding not indicative of any genotoxicity of the test substance,
"other: not evaluated: because of inadequate response by the positive and negative controls, data from this experiment were considered meaningless",
other: False positive,
other: the compound induced a moderate increase in mutant fraction (it was only tested without metabolic activation),
other: not applicable,
"other: Weakly positive , a weak increase in the induction of gene mutations was observed at the highest investigated concentration (1600 µg/mL) in the first experiment.",positive
other: equivocal,
other: see remarks below,
other: Data available after Linde and Ikaria have been informed and granted permission,
other: Negative control is the same as vehicle control within this study.,
other: positive only in highly cytotxic concentrations,positive
other: weakly positive,positive
"other: the increases in mutant frequency were small and only occurred at a dose that caused high toxicity, the result was judged to indicate  borderline activity",
other: on-going,
other: see applicant´s remarks,
other: mutation frequency was elevated relative to controls in some dose groups for “amorphous NiS”,
other: positive only with cytotoxicity in the absence of S9,positive
other: Study in progress,
other: no transforming activity,
other: Inconclusive. With and without S9,
other: some evidence of a mutagenic response,
"other: (-S9) = equivocal (defined in the study report as the absence of a dose-response relationship, but the presence of a two-fold increase in mutant frequency over background at any of the doses examined) and (+S9) = negative",
"other: no increases in mutant frequency were observed in the absence or presence of S9 metabolic activation, at any concentration level. A statistically significant increase in mutant frequency  highest dose level (lower than GEF, not biologically relevant)",
other:,
other: Negative response in the presence of activation. Some sporadic increases in mutant frequency were seen in cultures treated in the absence of activation. There was no clear dose dependent response and no reproducible mutagenic response within a single dose,
other: not mutagen,
other: No data,
"other: Without S9 activation, 1,2-dichlorobenzene was evaluated as non-mutagenic. With S9 activation mutagenic activity was detected. See remarks",
other: clastogenic,
other: Positive results observed only with accompanying excessive cytotoxicity,
other: weakly positive (acc. to evaluation criteria layed down in the study report); ambigious (acc. to lately recommended evaluation criteria),
other: Inconclusive With and without S9,
other: Negative by the first criteria and inconclusive by the second,
other: To be determined,
"other: positive with S9 mix, negative in coculture with rat hepatocytes",
other: study in progress,
