not determined,
not specified,
other: Negative in the presence of metabolic activation; equivocal without metabolic activation,
other: inconclusive,
other: The positive result was considered to  be due to a cytotoxic mechanism and to have no biological relevance,
other: Clastogenic activity,
"other: positive structural, negative numerical",
other: inconclusive due to diverging results in relevant duplicates,
other: inconclusive as out of the recommended range accoring to the revised guideline from 2016,
other: weakly clastogenic,
other: Chromosomal aberrations were only observed at cytotoxic concentrations,
other: dose related increases in gap-type aberrations only,
other: weakly,
"other: With metabolic activation, there was a significant increase in the proportion of polyploid cells. Without metabolic activation, there was a significant increase both in chromosomal aberrations and the proportion of polyploid cells.",
other:,
other: The finding in this study is very likely to be a false positive due to osmotic effects,
