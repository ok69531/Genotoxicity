ambiguous,
not specified,
other: positive in strains TA 1537 and TA 98 in the absence of metabolic activation,positive

not determined,
other: positive but markedly reduced with respect to TA98,positive

other: This information not provided in the migrated SNIF dossier (SNIF # 001-3.0.10-01) provided by ECHA,
other: preliminary toxicity assay,
"other: not reliable, unacceptable for testing because the spontaneous reversion rates were twice the normal rate",

other: weakly positive when reevaluated by SCF negative,positive

other: No positive response observed,negative
other: weak positive effect at far in excess concentrations (>= 160 mg/plate),positive
other: test article induced gene mutations by frameshifts in the genome of the strain TA 1537 and shows a possible mutagenic potential in the strain TA 98.,positive

other: see remarks on results including tables and figures and overall remarks,
other: positive only in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100,positive
other: S typhimurium TA1537 and TA 98 gave positive results: TA1535 and TA 100 yielded negative results,positive

other: extremely weak,positive
other: slight increase in number of revertant colonies at 750 and 1000 µg/plate with S9 in the plate incorporation assay; not dose-dependent and not reproduced in the pre-incubation assay,positive
